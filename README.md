# Stock and Cryptocurrency Tracker

## Description
This project is a terminal-based stock and cryptocurrency tracker. It allows users to add or remove assets from their list and uses SQLite to manage and store this data. The project is implemented in Python 3.12.

The tracker communicates with a variety of external APIs to fetch real-time stock and crypto data. Future plans for this project include implementing machine learning algorithms for predictive modelling, and determining buy or sell signals based on this modelling. 

## Installation
1. Clone the repository - git clone https://github.com/<JackRKennedy>/stockTracker cd stockTracker
2. Install the requirements

This will start the tracker and you will be able to add or remove assets from your list.
